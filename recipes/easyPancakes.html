    <p>I sure hope these pancakes are easy and cheap to make. As a professional broke college student, I will garble up any free or inexpensive food without hesitation. The dining hall pancakes are never cooked on both sides. The guy at the stove just lets them cook only on one side and then calls it a day. Good job bud, but no thanks.</p>
    <p>I've decided to invest in these "easy pancakes", and with a cook time of only 20 minutes, I don't have a lot to complain about. I don't really care about the taste as long as I can digest it easily. I'm copying all ingredients and steps from the all recipes website, NO PLAGIARISM</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
