        <p>I have loved Red Velvet Cookies since I was a child. I was shocked when I found out that
            red velvet is just another kind of chocolate. I didn't know what else red velvet would be, but nevertheless I was still shocked.
        </p>
        <p>The bold dark red of these cookies is enough to make your mouth water. When you finally sink your teeth into these delectable cookies, you fell the full force of the FLAVOR! </p>
